# convolutionalVAE_pytorch

I try to implement this for getting familiar with pytorch.

The reconstruction result is worse than previopus torch implementation (https://github.com/FlappyDoraemon/cvae). Why?

If you have any suggesstion or improvement, please told me through han424@purdue.edu. I am a beginner for both torch and pytorch.

The default dataloader was not used and I directly use a previously saved (n, 3, 128, 128) stl-10 dataset. I think this way is more convenient.
