# convolutionalVAE_pytorch
a pytorch implementation of convolutional VAE for learning pytorch

I try to implement this for getting familiar with pytorch.

The reconstruction result is worse than previopus torch implementation (https://github.com/FlappyDoraemon/cvae)?

If you have any suggesstion or improvement, please told me through han424@purdue.edu. I am a beginner for both torch and pytorch.
